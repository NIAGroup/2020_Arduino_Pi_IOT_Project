/*
 * Author :  Princton Brennan
 * Purpose : Beginner's Example for sensor reading & PWM writing 
 * Requirements : 1 LED, Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (model - HC-SR04), & an Arduino   
 * 
 * Function : The sensor will be used to measure an object's distance (your hand works fine) 
 * in inches and centimeters and adjusts the intensity of an LED based on that distance. 
 * The LED will increase it's intensity as the object gets closer, and adversely decrease as
 * the object is move further away. The distance & intensity values will be visible in the
 * arduino ide serial monitor. 
 * 
 * NOTE :: Most LED's that come in kits are rated for 3V, so to be safe the maximum equivalent voltage  
 * that will be written to set the LED's intensity will be 2.5V. 
 * 
 * NOTE :: This original code was written to work with the Arduino Mega, Uno, & Nano boards
 * as they provide a 5V supply pin. This is needed to power the sensor.

// For good practice to not waste memory, smaller variable types are used when possible 
// (e.g. using byte (8 bit length) instead of an int (32bit length)
// Additionally, constants are used for values that will not change.   
const byte ledPin =  11;          // The LED pin assigned to pin 11. (Be sure that this is a PWM pin on your board by reviewing your board's pinout).
byte led_intensity_val;           // The maximum value of a byte is 255, which translates to the maximum output voltage for PWM 

/*
 * The variables below will be used for controlling the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
 * It will require 2 digital pins: trigger & echo
 * Both must be used to send the ultrasonic signal, and another is used to capture
 * the signal once it returns. The distance will be calculated for inches & centimeters
 * NOTE: These values can be adjusted
 *
