 * Author :  Princton Brennan
 * Purpose : Beginner's Example for Bluetooth Communication 
 * Requirements : 1 LED, Bluetooh Module Hc-05 or newer), an Arduino, &   
 * a Bluetooth Terminal App (or something similar).
 * 
 * Function : The arduino will turn an LED on or off depending on the 
 * commands via Blueooth.
 * 
 * NOTE :: Most LED's that come in kits are rated for 3V, so to be safe place a 150ohm
 * to 250ohm resistor in series with the LED for current limiting. 
 * 
 * HC-05 example : https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/getting-started-with-hc-05-bluetooth-module-arduino-e0ca81
 * 
 * This sketch uses the "SoftwareSerial" Library:
 * 
 * The Arduino hardware has built-in support for serial communication on pins 0 and 1 
 * (which also goes to the computer via the USB connection). The native serial support 
 * happens via a piece of hardware (built into the chip) called a UART. This hardware 
 * allows the Atmega chip to receive serial communication even while working on other 
 * tasks, as long as there room in the 64 byte serial buffer.
 * 
 * The SoftwareSerial library has been developed to allow serial communication on other 
 * digital pins of the Arduino, using software to replicate the functionality (hence the 
 * name "SoftwareSerial"). It is possible to have multiple software serial ports with 
 * speeds up to 115200 bps. A parameter enables inverted signaling for devices which require 
 * that protocol.
